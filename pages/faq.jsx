       The expected hold period varies from property to property, typically 2,5, or 10. A hold period is the anticipated time investors will be involved with the investment until the underlying property is re-sold. However, we are currently exploring a secondary marketplace that would allow investors to sell their shares pending an initial 1-year lockup period. There is no guarantee this marketplace will be established, that there will be demand for your shares, or that the secondary market will provide a trading forum. It is important that you are able to hold your investment for the intended hold period.       </Accordion.Body>

With that fact established, we understand the value of total due diligence, deep underwriting of potential investments, and other basics that control our risk. We are committed to offering only investments that meet our stringent criteria.
